	<h3>Section 1</h3>
	<strong><i>Explain how technology, and computer science specifically, have altered the way people interact with information since the industrial revolution.</i></strong>
	<p>During the Industrial Revolution, Johannes Gutenberg invented the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_press">printing press</a>. This invention allowed citizens to read stories and books (mostly religion and science based). Eventually, they started making newspapers that people could read to catch up on news in their town or country. For the first time, people were gaining current knowledge in ways that were not possible before, and they could use this to make informed decisions about their daily lives.</p>

	<p>In the new age of technology we have hundreds of thousands of online news sources. We receive alerts for breaking news from major sources right on our phones. We can read news articles seconds after they are released.</p>

	<h3>Section 2</h3>
	<strong><i>How does this change in access to information affect the economy? Overall do you think it is good or bad and why?  What is a specific example to support your claim?</i></strong>
	<ul>
	<li>People can check on the stock market in seconds</li>
	<li>It is good, we can make more informed decisions about things</li>
	<li>A good example would be the stock market example. You wouldn't know the market crashed in the 30s until you heard it on your local news radio or on a television. Now, if it crashed our phones would be giving tons of alerts.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h3>Section 3</h3>
	<strong><i>How does access to information affect the way people interact with each other?Overall do you think it is good or bad and why?  What is a specific example to support your claim?</i></strong>
	<ul>
	<li>People can communicate instantly (via aptly named "Instant Messaging") with technology. We can arrange dinner parties, study meets; talk with friends in other countries as if they were beside you; and make relationships through dating apps.</li>
	<li>This is a good thing, because things can get done a lot faster. Doing things faster means for time to do other things.</li>
	<li>The other day my friend needed help with his computer. He told me what the problem was and I sent him instructions to fix it. They worked, and it all took maybe 10 minutes. In the past, for things like a television or radio repair, you would have needed to call the operator through a switchboard. He would then connect you to a repair business, who would need to find a time that works for both of you for them to come and fix it. Then they would need to actually get there, and if they have bad directions, they could get lost. I could go on but my point has been made.</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<h3>Section 4</h3>
	<strong><i>How does this change in access to information affect the politics? Overall do you think it is good or bad and why?  What is a specific example to support your claim?</i></strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Political leaders can reach a much wider audience at a much faster rate.</li>
	<li>This is both good and bad, because while they can easily get their message to their people, sometimes the message may turn followers away from them. Or, a typo in a tweet or memo can hinder a reputation.</li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/ABCPolitics/status/722238695319801856">Here is a good example</a>. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niSLZDVApdQ&ab_channel=XavierR.">this one</a> (turn up the volume a bit for both).</li>
	</ul>
